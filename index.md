This is beauty, sin.

This is monster, evil. It cycles up like so, and away...

We experimented with lumenodes. They captured photons, inwards and outwards.

Our eye is an independent cognitive unit. The world we see is one which is very powerful.

But we could not understand it. It appears like a haze to us. We cannot even begin to understand what is present in the lumenrays. It is like noise, too sharp and grainy: like looking into the sun. And there is nothing when you look into the sun: you may be looking into space.

The lumenographers say, "this is the real world. You just can't see it." But they cannot be right. This cannot be the real world. For I have seen what is real with my own eyes. 

No, these are not the ways to live. Our eyes see all.

Concept: Documenting important images throughout history. But most important was the Tsvet. When the Tsvet happened, everything changed. Things became fuzzy and incomprehensible. Lines: disobeying geometry. We could not comprehend it.

Primitive cameras: but our organs were always poorly suited towards these simple results. They would need extensive code processing to produce renderable results. 

Development: eventually vision becomes directly abstract, fuzzy forms. And we became a world of seeing. We lived all we needed or wanted to live by seeing. 

<!-- We live in a television. We are sad, but we have supports for it.


Жизнь -- это цирк, так что **добро пожаловать на наше представление**. Life is a circus, so welcome to our performance. tserk is a beautiful place, but it's not the beauty you know. To you, it is ugly and sad. But you will understand. It is a world of melancholy. We are forcefully abstracted from our individuated experience. We are always within and outside of the screen. We are not happy. But we do not need to be happy, because we live beautiful lives.

We are always watching. When we watch enough, we become. We never just watch. When we watch close enough, we feel where we came from.

Mother has sinned. Mother has eaten from the apple. God threw her from Eden to Earth, then she jumped off Earth to Hell, where she continued to eat the apple.

Out of the apple, came I.
