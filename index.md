**When we do not know where to go**, we follow the signs. Sometimes, this is simple, because there is one direction we can go. It does not matter if we do not know where we will go.

But when there are two directions we can go, it is more complicated. We need to know where we will go. If we are going in one direction, we are not going in another. Because we cannot go in all directions at once, there is a sense of loss. Directions do not direct us towards endings, but rather direct us away from other directions: a recursive, absolutely negative entanglement. 
But it is at this juncture where I, the traveler, experience the most radical moment of freedom. Sweet, precious freedom. How anxious authentic freedom is. I do not think I like my freedom very much. Please do not make me choose, because I am incompetent. I am stupid. I am illiterate. I cannot read. Please liberate me from my freedom.

Sometimes, we need to go in both directions to arrive home. Now this is confusing.
